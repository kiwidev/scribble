# [Proposal] Publish Documentation

It should be really easy to take your Markdown files and publish them somewhere

What sort of publishing?

 - GitHub Pages - switch to gh-pages branch, replace content with generated HTML/CSS/JS, commit, push
 - Jekyll - support for Heroku deployments (how compatible is this with gh-pages setup?)
 - FTP - replace content with generated HTML/CSS/JS (requires config, permissions, etc)
 - Zip - export the generated content to some location
 - ???
