No-one likes writing documentation because it's not fun. This is the problem Scribble is looking to solve.

<a href="#" class="image image-full"><img src="/images/n33-robot-invader.jpg" alt="" /></a>

## I want to try it out!

Pre-release packages are available on NuGet. If you're feeling bold, go try them out!

<div class="nuget-badge">
  <p><code>PM&gt; Install-Package scribble -Pre</code></p>
</div>

And then follow the [Getting Started](/pages/getting-started.html) guide.

## Why should I care?

A few reasons:

### I don't want to use [terrible markup syntax here]

The more you have to fight with the tool or framework, the easier it is to neglect documentation - which leads to atrophy and the existing documentation losing it's value.

Plus XML is almost certainly terrible for humans.

Scribble uses Markdown at it's core. If you've never heard of Markdown, it's a lightweight markup syntax for turning text into HTML. It's been used in question-and-answer sites like StackOverflow, various blogging engines and sites, and other place too I'll bet.

It's easy to learn and has a feature set which fits with what developers need to describe their software, so it's a great match for what Scribble needs.

### I want to include code snippets without manually updating them

Yes! Using code to demonstrate your features is excellent, but you want to use your real code - not some copy-paste effort which means you'll have to edit it again later.



### It should be easy to publish my documentation
