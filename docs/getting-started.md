## Getting Started

Once you've installed the NuGet package, you should see two things:

### the index.md file open in Visual Studio


### the documentation site open in your browser


The "documentation site" should be a collection of Markdown content files and Jekyll site structure.

**TODO:** discuss Jekyll concepts and why this is a good thing
