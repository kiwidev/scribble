## Proposals

There are a number of features which are in the process of being outlined as specifications. 

These features are not listed based on priority - however a more clearly-defined specification is more likely to be implemented.

### Configuration Settings

 - **What?** Being able to configure your environment rather than having to remember to provide the same arguments each time you call specific function
 - **Why?** Because humans are forgetful and automation is awesome
