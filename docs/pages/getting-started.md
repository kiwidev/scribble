## Getting Started in 3 easy steps

 - Open your project in Visual Studio
 - Install the package from the Package Manager Console
 - There is no step 3

As part of the installation, Scribble will create the folder structure under `docs` at the root of your project (or repository if it can find a git/hg repository)

Scribble will also open the Markdown template for the index so you can start editing quickly

In the background Scribble will open a tiny webserver to transform the Markdown files and other files into a website which you can view immediately in the browser
