# Add a new page

Once you've created your docs folder, the next step is to insert a new page into your documentation.

`duchess add "This is a page name"`

This should add a new file, named `this-is-a-page-name.md`, inside the `docs` folder.

It should open the new file inside Visual Studio, which is pre-populated from a predefined layout and content.
