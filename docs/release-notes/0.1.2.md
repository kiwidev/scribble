Progressing through slowly, getting more of the happy path underway

# Features
 
 - Expanded on template site content to introduce various features
 - Integrated Powershell script from @tathamoddie to run pretzel from command line
 - Reopening new solution initializes package again (which has its pros and cons)

# Bugfixes

 - Making my Powershell script less hacky

# Known Issues
 
 - Juggling the multiple responsibilities of `init.ps1` (setup, insteall, upgrade) means the script is far from robust right now
 - Demo site is hard-coded to 40000 - should be stored in config so that different projects can be used concurrently
 - Same initialization code runs every time (i think this is a limit of solution packages as init.ps1 is the only hook)
