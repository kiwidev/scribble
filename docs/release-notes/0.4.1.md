Cleanup and general refactoring

 Features:

  - #8 - added `Start-Preview` command so you can start the previewer at any time. Supports using default browser by passing `-ExternalBrowser` parameter.

Bugfixes:

 - #5 - Did not create folders / documentation in VS2012 - environmental issue
 - #7 - Still have issues in VS2012 - handling folder paths with spaces was busted
 - Introduced Pretzel v0.9.21 which fixes an issue with integration with Sublime Text (correctly now)
 - #12 - took control of loading browser on install away from Pretzel and into VS browser
 - #14 - updated Pretzel to ignore .tmp files when it goes and finds all files to process
