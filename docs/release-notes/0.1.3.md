Refining the install/upgrade/startup script

# TODO

 - Make the powershell scripts more modular (anything good to google with?)
 - I don't like nuget.exe shouting at me about additional .ps1 scripts - am i doing it right?
 
Core Changes

 - Duchess -> Scribble

Project structure

 - config file is a json file which is read/written by package
 - script should read that port number on startup and pass it to pretzel
 - include a simple site layout with some CSS to get started (semantic-release-notes?)
 - script should generate a new port number between 30000-50000 on install and store it into the settings
