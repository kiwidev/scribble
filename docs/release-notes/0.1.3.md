Refining the install/upgrade/startup script

# TODO

 - include a simple site layout with some CSS to get started (semantic-release-notes?)
 - Make the powershell scripts more modular (anything good to google with?)
 - I don't like nuget.exe shouting at me about additional .ps1 scripts - am i doing it right?
 - Modify .duchess file contents to be a json blob and read/write the version 
 - script should generate a new port number between 30000-50000 on install and store it into the settings
 - script should read that port number on startup and pass it to pretzel
