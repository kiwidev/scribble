# Limitations

## Jekyll compatibility issues

 - at the moment we only support a subset of Jekyll's functionality (that is, the non-Ruby pieces) and I'm almost at the point where I need that functionality

## Managing environments when publishing

 - is there a need to have different environments to publish documentation to (say, staging versus live)  
   - how will this impact configuration settings?
