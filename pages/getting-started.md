## Getting Started with scribble

### Three steps

 - Open your project in Visual Studio
 - Install the package from the Package Manager Console
 - There is no step 3

As part of the installation, Scribble will create the folder structure under `docs` at the root of your project (or repository if it can find a git/hg repository)

Scribble will also open the Markdown template for the index so you can start editing quickly

![edit the file]({{ site.baseurl }}images/introduction/edit-file.png)

In the background Scribble will open a tiny webserver to transform the Markdown files and other files into a website which you can view immediately in the browser

### And start editing!

Experiment with editing the `index.md` file and saving changes.

Scribble will detect your changes and recompile the content - so you can refresh the page and see your changes applied immediately.
