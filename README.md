Scribble
=======

Scribble is a NuGet package to do the heavy lifting of creating and maintaining documentation in your projects.

Check the [wiki](https://github.com/shiftkey/duchess/wiki) for details about the concepts and ideas.

Specifically it is designed to:

 - make documentation easy and fun to write
 - keep code and documentation in sync
 - take your documentation and export it 

### Getting Started in 3 easy steps

 - Open your project in Visual Studio
 - `Install-Package scribble -Pre` from the Package Manager Console
 - There is no step 3

As part of the installation, Scribble will create the folder structure under `docs` in your solution folder (or repository root if it detects a git/hg repository) and open the site in your default browser.

When you open the solution after subsequent usages, the previewer will startup again so you can keep your documentation close.
